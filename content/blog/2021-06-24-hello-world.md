To my surprise, markdown is presented as some tool of writing content and implementing it to your website. Despite the coolness factor of writing in monospaced font, I do miss the comfort that gave me writing in the admin panel in Wordpress. Oh, well, different solutions for different clients.

```js
this.die()
```

I doubt I'd like to transfer a comic site to a configuration like this... I think the best feature of the simplecomic is the fetching of previous and next pages, which I could probably manage in other CMS being orderly about the date, but it's still the kind of thing I like having in a plataform or something. But aside from that, there's not much other requirements for it. Only the image, other variables like alt text and the transcript but otherwise it could be migrated here with some considerations.

My best candidate is the recipes site. Many fields that are straightforward and not much more detailed data. Things like recipe quantities and calculation might be left on a lower priority, I'd like to keep the simplicity of writing up a text document and saving it. So even without the existence of the site, you would have a perfectly readable recipe.
